# Project EPSILON

Why Epsilon? Honestly because it comes before Lambda in the Greek alphabet. Also, it sounds cool; so. **What is this project!?** A remote code execution engine (RCE) or Functions as a Service (FAAS) platform (think Lambda, Cloud Functions,,, hopefully the name Epsilon makes sense now) project built with an over reliance on Kubernetes.
